# Shelby's Front-end Portfolio

**This project was built to showcase Shelby Shipley's (my) front-end development skills.**

It features previous websites I've built, information about me, ways to get in touch, and some of my personal blogs & digital art for you to gaze upon.

This project was created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Runs the project in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Acknowledgements

Most of the assets were created by me, Shelby, using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

On the About page, the skills icons are featured using [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons). All of the icons come from the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

The color scheme of this project was chosen with help from [hue.tools](https://hue.tools/info?color=18181bff&format=hex), which is a very cool color tool made by [pabue.co](https://pabue.co/).

## Project Status

This portfolio is a work in progress! More blogs and art will be added as I develop as a developer.
