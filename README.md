# Shelby's Front-end Portfolio

**This project was built to showcase Shelby Shipley's (my) front-end development skills.**

It features previous websites I've built, information about me, ways to get in touch, and some of my personal blogs & digital art for you to gaze upon.

This project was created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and will be hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

```

Runs the project in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
