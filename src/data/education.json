      "content": "To say I am a self-taught web developer is an unfair assessment. Without the seemingly infinite collections of computer science knowledge available at the click of a mouse and the incredible educators strewn about the internet I would know close to nothing. I wouldn’t be able to construct useful tools like my recipe catalog, Larder to Table, or my reading blog, Under the Shelf (see Sites for more details). I wouldn’t be able to see the joy on my nephews’ and nieces’ faces while they play the Snake Game I built. In the past two years of study I have learned that the continuous pursuit of knowledge is the most critical aspect of developing on the web; followed closely by giving that knowledge back to your community."
